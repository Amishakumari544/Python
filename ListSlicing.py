# Advanced Indexing in NumPy Python we can't multiply list with normal print functions directly.
# For example we cannot multiply two lists directly we will have to do it element wise. This is where the role of NumPy comes into play.
# because it gives error = TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'list'
# Indexing can be done in numpy by using an array as an index
